#The Future Nations of Track Cycling? 

####Thursday 21 st July Aigle Switzerland:

Day two of the 2016 Junior World Track Championships at the World Cycling Centre in Aigle Switzerland sees European teams pursuit champions Italy takeout the women’s event in a masterful display against New Zealand, while the New Zealand men’s teams pursuit squad smash the world record and opponents Denmark on their way through to rainbow glory.

Meanwhile over in the scratch race, Mongolia’s Batsaikhan Tegshbayar seems to easily win the junior men’s scratch race.

So what’s wrong with this story? Nothing except that we’ve been used to seeing the Aussies or Brits, renowned powerhouses, dominate these events often lining up against each other for an “ashes like” gold medal ride off.

Sure the scratch race is a mixed bag where anyone’s dream can come true, but does the emergence of the likes of New Zealand, Italy, China, Canada or Mongolia somehow signal a changing of the guard? History is never a predictor of the future, so dominant and established countries need to keep innovating to stay at the top of their game.

British Cycling were able to take giant leaps forward with the injection of funds into the sport through the British Lottery Commission, allowing Team GB to hire the top coaching and support staff from around the world who plotted and planned world dominance for their elite teams to within an inch of its life whilst infiltrating almost every school yard in the country promoting their brand.

Poor cousins Australia carried on in the true Aussie battler style, without the funding, punching well above their weight in the international arena.

The bronzed Aussies were the golden children of the world’s velodromes.

Now perhaps we are witnessing the arrival of new nations on the world stage and we have to ask the question why? What has elicited this transformation? At grass roots level are Australian kids riding their bikes less or engaging insport less overall? Are current coaching methods in need of an overhaul? Are our teenagers more focused now on education and less on sport?  Is it somehow different in New Zealand or Italy or Mongolia?  Nature or nurture, culture or innovation, funding or not, the answer is difficult to determine but the emergence of these new leaders of the sport show us opportunity.

Opportunity for development and change.

Opportunity for new relationships to be built.

The Pacific Youth Track Tournament (PYTT) exists to offer young athletes anopportunity to compete on the world stage, to experience other cultures and participate in a world-class event that assists with the development of theirfuture.

From the Match Sprint to the Omnium, two of our Pacific Youth Track Tournament partners, China and Hong Kong, are producing international medalists at senior level and are set to take the world by storm with their eyes firmly set on Rio, Tokyo and beyond.

There is no denying that with these young athletes and their federations set to dominate it raises the question - How far the gap between between junior development and senior performance at the top level and how did they get there?  Clearly the encouragement and promotion of grass roots participation will lay the foundations of a future in this discipline.

Then, the task of development at the next level, a commitment made with aperpetual plan.

Imagine a syndicate made up of Hong Kong, China, Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, Korea, Japan, and Western Australia.

A syndicate who work together, embrace change, share knowledge and fellowship and hold events for their young countrymen and women to compete in.

I wonder what we could call it? Move over Team GB, here comes Team PYTT.
