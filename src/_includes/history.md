The close proximity between Western Australia and Asia has
fostered strong bond between the two through cultural exchange,
tourism, business, education and sport.

Western Australia’s close connection with Asia and the sport of
cycling was strengthened almost two decades ago with the birth of
the “City of Perth” road cycling team.

This team gave Western Australian cyclists the opportunity to traveland compete in major Asian road cycling tours.

Relationships were cemented between Perth cycling representative
Mr. Terry Simms and cycling federations and race organisers
throughout Asia. Many local riders benefited from these
international events.

As Sydney Australia was gearing up for the 2000 Summer Olympics,
Mr. Simms met with like-minded Asian cycling officials and
formulated a plan aimed at promoting Junior Track Cycling, the
grass roots of our sport.

There was born the concept of the “Pacific Youth Track
Tournament”, an event for junior under 15 and under 17 cyclists.
The objective of this new initiative was to promote and foster junior cycling and the PYTT event would give junior cyclists not only the opportunity to compete in a truly international event but the hope that it would give them a “life’s experience” in the process.

Asian countries and team(s) from Western Australia are the
accepted entrants into the PYTT competition.
 
The first event was held in Kaohsiung in 2000. It has been held in
Bangkok, Perth, Hong Kong and Kaohsiung again in 2012. Perth will
again host the event from 26 th – 28 th September 2016.
