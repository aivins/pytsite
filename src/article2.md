First held in Kaohsiung Taiwan in 2001, the event was
created by track cycling groups and federations
representing the City of Perth, Hong Kong, Korea, Thailand,
Taiwan, Malaysia and China.

With their vision focussed on the future this league of
countries have created a culturally diverse bi-annual
tournament, which is now fifteen years old.

In September this year, over 100 elite international athletes
will compete against Western Australian clubs including
power-house local junior club Midland Cycle Club.
 The club,
dating back over 100 years, is synonymous with producing
young champions on track and road and boasts many World
and Olympic champions.

One upcoming young sprint talent and national medallist is
Midland Cycle Club’s Rihana Pezaj “I’m just so excited to race
at this tournament, it’s such a great opportunity to prepare
for international competition before I move into U19’s.
”
Founding member of the Pacific Youth Track Tournament
family, Track Cycling WA will also field very strong teams
hoping to give locals and internationals alike a run for their
money.

Current Australian National U15 Champion of Champions
Dharlia Haines will also get the chance to test her legs
against some formidable international competition.
 “ As an
U15 international racing is unheard of.
 I’m very proud to
have been awarded the champion of champion’s jersey at
track nationals earlier this year and I’m really looking
forward to representing my club against some of the most
talented girls in Asia.
”
The world-class Siberian Pine indoor velodrome is located at
the gateway to the Swan Valley at the base of the Darling
scarp.
 The venue has hosted Junior World Championships in
1995, senior world championships in 1997, Annual
International Track Cycling Grand Prix’s and a previous
round of the Pacific Youth Track Tournament in 2006.

International athletes will be residing at the iconic Guildford
Grammar School boarding halls of residence during their
stay and the tournament is injecting some urgency into the
legs of local school children with district schools fielding
teams who will compete for the inaugural school’s team cup.

Event organisers Track Cycling WA and National Cycling
Centre WA are excited about the legacy the 2016 Pacific
Youth Track Tournament will leave to the local community.

“ We have formed strategic partnerships with local business,
government agencies, schools and indigenous communities
to promote healthy and active lifestyles through our grass
roots junior cycling initiatives, the introduction of schools
league competition, all the way through to opportunities for
high performance development” event co-ordinator Amanda
O’Connor.

Racing takes place over three days from 26 th – 28 th
September at the Midvale SpeedDome.
